    <div class="one">
      <span class="one-min">A skeleton standing on a rock.</span>
      <span class="one-max">This image is a stunning monochromatic representation, dominated by shades of grey and white. It depicts a skeleton standing on a rock, positioning itself in an almost heroic posture. The skeleton, which carries mammalian characteristics, covers a large portion of the image. Intriguingly, there is a suggestion of a rhinoceros present behind the skeleton, creating an unusual juxtaposition between the forms of life and death, nature and the supernatural. The image carries the aesthetics of a sketch or drawing, possibly a painting, hinting at an artistic purpose. The metadata indicates that the image is derived from "Tabulae sceleti et musculorum" by Bernhard Albinus the Younger, a publication from 1747, which further adds to its historical and academic value.</span>

    <div class="two">
      <span class="two-min">A group of skeletons of dinosaurs.</span>
      <span class="two-max">This image primarily features a group of dinosaur skeletons in various shapes, sizes, and postures. The skeletons are intricately detailed and meticulously arranged, creating a dramatic visual impact. This image is monochromatic, with dominant shades of grey and white. The text "SKELETTEN VAN DE REUZENLUIAARDS" appears in the image, which translates to "Skeletons of the Giant Sloths" in English. In addition to the dinosaur skeletons, there are hints of an animal and mammal presence as well, suggesting a diverse ecosystem. Despite the inherent starkness, the image is filled with the mystery and wonder of prehistoric life.</span>
